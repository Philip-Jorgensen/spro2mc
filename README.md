## Rules to making changes to the code.
<ul>
  <li> When you make a new change to the code, start a new branch first and edit in that. <ul>
    <li> You can find a guide to making a new branch <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> here.</a> </li></ul></li>
  <li> Add proper comments and explanations in your code, it makes it easier to see what that exact part does afterwards. </li>
</ul>
